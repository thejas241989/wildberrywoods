Developer notes

- Ensure Node.js 18 is used (see .nvmrc)
- Run `npm ci` in CI to install pinned dependencies
- This project currently contains no application files â€” scaffold or copy files into the workspace before running `npm run dev`.
- Tailwind will be used; after scaffolding, create tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js as needed.
